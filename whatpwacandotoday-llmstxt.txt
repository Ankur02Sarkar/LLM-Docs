## Audio Session API
_keyboard\_backspace__wifi\_off_

## AudioSession API

This feature is not (yet) supported on your device

The Audio Session API configures how audio from web apps should mix with audio from native apps.


### Demo

On a supporting device, play audio from another native app (for example, Music on iOS) and then also play the
audio below with the radiobutton "auto" selected. You will notice the audio from the other app will be paused.


If you restart the audio from the other app and then play the audio below again with the radiobutton "transient"
selected, you will notice the audio from the other app will not be paused but will be mixed with this audio.


If you do it the other way around and start audio from this app first and then play audio from another app with the
radiobutton "auto" selected, you will notice that the audio from this app will be paused.


If you play audio from this app and then switch to another app with the radiobutton "transient" selected, the
audio will be paused but if you then switch back to this app, the audio will resume playing. If you keep the
audio from the other app playing when you switch back to this app, the audio will be mixed with the audio from the
other app.

## Viewport Interactive Widget
_keyboard\_backspace__wifi\_off_

## Viewport: interactive-widget

This feature is not (yet) supported on your device

The `content` attribute of the `viewport` meta tag is used to control how the viewport of the page
behaves when an interactive widget like an on-screen keyboard is shown.


Example:

`<meta name="viewport" content="interactive-widget=resizes-visual">`

`interactive-widget` can take the following values:

- `resizes-visual`: The keyboard resizes the Visual Viewport, the content of the page may be pushed up when
the keyboard is shown. Elements with `position: fixed` will remain in place and can be obscured by the keyboard.
- `resizes-content`: The keyboard resizes the both the Visual Viewport and the Layout Viewport, the content of
the page may be pushed up when the keyboard is shown. Elements with `position: fixed` will can be pushed up as well.
- `overlays-content`: The keyboard overlays the viewport and both the Visual Viewport and the Layout Viewport will not be
resized, the content of the page will remain in place.

### Demo


Tap the textfield below to show the on-screen keyboard. Change the value of "interactive-widget" with the radio buttons
to see how the keyboard interacts with the viewport.

## PWA Installation Guide
_keyboard\_backspace__wifi\_off_

## Installation

Progressive Web Apps can be installed to the home screen on mobile devices and desktop on laptops and desktop
computers. On Chromium based browsers, the `beforeinstallprompt` event is fired when the web app is
eligible to be installed. This event will display a native install dialog that includes a button to install the
web app.


## Demo

Click the "Install" button below to install this web app. In supporting browsers, the native install dialog will
appear and in non-supporting browsers, a bottom sheet with instructions how to install this web app will be
displayed.


Install to home screen_add\_to\_home\_screen_

## Experimental: Web Install API

The Web Install API allows web apps to be installed to the home screen of a device. It can be used to install the current web app
or web apps from other domains. This enables installing web apps from app stores for example.


To install the current web app, use `navigator.install();`

To install a web app from another domain, use `navigator.install('https://otherdomain.com', 'https://otherdomain.com/app-id');`
where the second argument is the Computed app ID of the web app.


To find the Computed app ID, open the Application tab in the Chrome DevTools, click "Manifest" on the left, and look for the "Computed app ID" field in the right pane.


The Web Install API is supported in Chrome and Edge 143+ through an origin trial.


## Demo

Click the button below to install the [store.app](https://store.app/) and
[pwastore.io](https://www.pwastore.io/) web apps from this PWA.


Install store.app![](https://whatpwacando.today/src/img/store.app-24x24.png)

Install pwastore.io![](https://whatpwacando.today/src/img/pwastore-32x32.png)

## Handling the install prompt

A best-practice is to defer the display of the install dialog using `event.preventDefault()` and
displaying it when it makes more sense, for example, when the user explicitly clicks a button to install the web
app.


_content\_copy_Code

```js

let deferredEvent;

window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  // prevent the browser from displaying the default install dialog
  e.preventDefault();

  // Stash the event so it can be triggered later when the user clicks the button
  deferredEvent = e;
});

installButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // if the deferredEvent exists, call its prompt method to display the install dialog
  if(deferredEvent) {
    deferredEvent.prompt();
  }
});

```

let deferredEvent;

window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
// prevent the browser from displaying the default install dialog
e.preventDefault();

// Stash the event so it can be triggered later when the user clicks the button
deferredEvent = e;
});

installButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
// if the deferredEvent exists, call its prompt method to display the install dialog
if(deferredEvent) {
deferredEvent.prompt();
}
});


For a web app to be eligible to be installed, it must meet some technical requirements:


- The web app must have a manifest.json file
- The web app must be served over https

The manifest.json file tells the browser how the PWA should appear and behave on the device and for a web app to
be installable it must have the following required members:


- `name` or `short_name`
- `icons` must contain a 192px and a 512px icon
- `start_url`
- `display` and/or `display_override`
- `prefer_related_applications` must be `false` or not present

For a description of these members, see the
[Web app manifest reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest)

In addition to these required members, a description of the web app and an optional array of screenshots can be
included that will be shown in the native install dialog, bringing the install process closer to that of native
apps.


Screenshots must follow these criteria:


- Width and height must be at least 320px and at most 3,840px.
- The maximum dimension can't be more than 2.3 times as long as the minimum dimension.
- All screenshots with the same form factor value must have identical aspect ratios.
- Only JPEG and PNG image formats are supported.
- Only eight screenshots will be shown. If more are added, the user agent simply ignores them.

In addition, all screenshots must have a `form_factor` property that indicates whether the screenshot is
displayed on mobile devices (value is "narrow") or desktop devices (value is "wide").

### Documentation

[Making Progressive Web Apps Installable on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Making_PWAs_installable)

### Browser support

The `beforeinstallprompt` event and the `screenshots` member of the manifest.json file are
supported in Chromium based browsers, including Chrome, Edge, and Opera. For other browsers, you need to display
a dialog with instructions on how to install the web app.

## PWA Push Notifications
_keyboard\_backspace__wifi\_off_

## Notifications

This feature is not (yet) supported on your device

This feature is only available on installed web apps

The Push API and Notifications API enable web apps to receive and display push notifications from a server, even
when the app is in the background or not running at all.


### Demo

Click the "Subscribe" button below to subscribe to notifications. Once subscribed, you will send a notification to
yourself by filling out the form below. You can specify a delay in seconds so you can schedule a notification and
close the app in the meantime to check it is delivered while the app is not running.


The "require interaction" checkbox will make the notification persistent on supporting devices, which means it will
not disappear until the user interacts with it.


Subscribe

Unsubscribe

You can send a notification through the form below.

## Declarative Web Push
_keyboard\_backspace__wifi\_off_

## Declarative Web Push

This feature is not (yet) supported on your device

This feature is only available on installed web apps

Declarative Web Push enables web apps to receive and display push notifications without a service worker, even
when the app is in the background or not running at all.


The benefit of this approach is that the web app doesn't have to take care of showing the notification so it will still be displayed,
even when the app doesn't implement functionality to display it or when there is an error in this code.


### Demo

Click the "Subscribe" button below to subscribe to notifications. Once subscribed, you will send a notification to
yourself by filling out the form below. You can specify a delay in seconds so you can schedule a notification and
close the app in the meantime to check it is delivered while the app is not running.

## PWA Information Hub
_keyboard\_backspace__wifi\_off_

## What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is basically just a website with some added features, which enable it to provide an
app-like user-experience.


This means it can work practically just like a native iOS or Android app. It can be installed to the home screen
of your mobile device, work offline and receive push notifications, among other things.


A well-designed PWA is indistinguishable from a native app, but it also offers some strong added benefits:


- It's just a website! You don't need to build separate apps anymore. If you have a website, you can easily
turn it into an iOS and Android app as well!

- A PWA is much smaller than a native app. Your users no longer need to install tens of megabytes of code

- No need to get your app into the App Store or Play Store. Just share the link to your website and users can
install it as an app

- There's no need to get users to install updates anymore. When you release a new version of your app, all your
users automatically get the new version

- By default, PWAs are served over HTTPS and are therefore safe and secure

- PWAs are lightweight and offer high performance

- Especially on Android, a PWA can almost do anything a native app can

## Web Bluetooth API
_keyboard\_backspace__wifi\_off_

## Web Bluetooth API

This feature is not (yet) supported on your device

The Web Bluetooth API enables apps to connect to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and read values from or write
values to it.


To test, connect to a BLE device that advertises the "battery\_service" service.


The easiest way is to download the
[BLE Peripheral Simulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.webbluetoothcg.bletestperipheral) app on another Android device and start the Battery service. Then change
the battery level and tap the "Notify" button. This app will then show the current battery level of the BLE device.


Tap "Scan" below to start scanning for BLE devices.


Scan

#### Battery level:

_content\_copy_Code

```js

if('bluetooth' in navigator) {
  const scan = document.querySelector('#scan');
  const batteryIndicator = document.querySelector('#battery-indicator');

  scan.addEventListener('click', async () => {

    const connectToDevice = async ({bleService, bleCharacteristic}) => {
      try {
        const device = await navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
          filters: [{\
            services: [bleService]\
          }]
        });

        device.addEventListener('gattserverdisconnected', () => {
          batteryIndicator.value = 0;
        });

        const server = await device.gatt.connect();
        const service = await server.getPrimaryService(bleService);
        const characteristic = await service.getCharacteristic(bleCharacteristic);
        await characteristic.startNotifications();

        characteristic.addEventListener('characteristicvaluechanged', e => {
          const value = e.target.value.getUint8(0);

          console.log(\`$\{bleCharacteristic\} changed\`, value);

          batteryIndicator.value = value;
        });

        characteristic.readValue();

        return characteristic;
      }
      catch(err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    };

    await connectToDevice({bleService: 'battery_service', bleCharacteristic: 'battery_level'});
  });
}

```


if('bluetooth' in navigator) {
const scan = document.querySelector('#scan');
const batteryIndicator = document.querySelector('#battery-indicator');

scan.addEventListener('click', async () => {

const connectToDevice = async ({bleService, bleCharacteristic}) => {
try {
const device = await navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
filters: \[{\
services: \[bleService\]\
}\]
});

device.addEventListener('gattserverdisconnected', () => {
batteryIndicator.value = 0;
});

const server = await device.gatt.connect();
const service = await server.getPrimaryService(bleService);
const characteristic = await service.getCharacteristic(bleCharacteristic);
await characteristic.startNotifications();

characteristic.addEventListener('characteristicvaluechanged', e => {
const value = e.target.value.getUint8(0);

console.log(\\\`$\\{bleCharacteristic\\} changed\\\`, value);

batteryIndicator.value = value;
});

characteristic.readValue();

return characteristic;
}
catch(err) {
console.error(err);
}
};

await connectToDevice({bleService: 'battery\_service', bleCharacteristic: 'battery\_level'});
});
}
